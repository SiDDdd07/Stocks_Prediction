This project implements a stock price prediction model using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras. It fetches historical stock data using the yfinance API and trains the LSTM model on closing prices to forecast the next day's stock price. The data is preprocessed with normalization and sequence generation to fit the temporal nature of financial time series. The model architecture includes stacked LSTM layers with dropout to prevent overfitting. Performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² score. This project serves as a practical example of using deep learning for time series forecasting in financial markets.
